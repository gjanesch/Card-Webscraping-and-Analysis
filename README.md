## Synopsis

This is a Python project concerning the Pokemon Trading Card Game (TCG).  The goals are two-fold:

1.) Using the BeautifulSoup library, scrape the contents of the Pokemon card listings on Serebii.net and store them into simple, custom objects.
2.) Run analyses on the resulting card data, with particular focus on the text of the cards and how some elements of the cards have changed over time.
